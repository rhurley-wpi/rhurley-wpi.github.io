  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <img src="profile.jpg" alt="Rachel Hurley" class="headshot">
  <p>I am a second-year PhD candidate in Civil Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, advised by Professor Shichao Liu. My research bridges environmental engineering and public health, with a focus on indoor air quality, wildfire smoke exposure, occupant health and behavior. I am eager to learn more about community-engaged research practices, developing smoke or natural disaster readiness plans, and am looking to expand the interdisciplinary nature of my work.</p>

  <p>My current projects examine re-emission of wildfire-sourced pollutants from building materials. Previously, I have investigated the impacts of elevated carbon dioxide exposure due to mask-wearing on student cognition during the COVID-19 pandemic. As an undergraduate student at Lafayette College, my research focused on predicting flash flooding behaviors in the mid-Atlantic region.</p>
