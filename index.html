      <h2>More About My Work</h2>
      <p>As the student representative to the International Society for Indoor Air Quality and Climate (ISIAQ), I support the next generation of indoor air researchers by coordinating student mentoring, networking, and skill-building workshops. I also lead the 2025 Autumn School in India, planning a two-day event for students prior to the Healthy Buildings Asia conference.</p>
      <p>At WPI, my work bridges environmental engineering and public health through community-engaged research. I am studying the re-emission of wildfire-sourced pollutants from building materials using advanced analytical techniques. I am also interested in how humans perceive and respond to indoor smoke exposure and what behaviors improve resilience.</p>
      <p>Previously, I worked with San Jose State University on home ignition zone evaluations in California, collecting data and using drone imagery to support wildfire preparedness efforts.</p>
