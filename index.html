        <div class="bio">
          <p>I am a second-year PhD student in Civil Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, advised by Professor Shichao Liu. My research bridges environmental engineering and public health, with a focus on indoor air quality, wildfire smoke exposure, occupant health and behavior. I am eager to learn more about community-engaged research practices, developing smoke or natural disaster readiness plans, and am looking to expand the interdisciplinary nature of my work.</p>
          <p>My current projects examine re-emission of wildfire-sourced pollutants from building materials. Previously, I have investigated the impacts of elevated carbon dioxide exposure due to mask-wearing on student cognition during the COVID-19 pandemic. As an undergraduate student at Lafayette College, my research focused on predicting flash flooding behaviors in the mid Atlantic region.</p>

      <h2>More About My Work</h2>
      <p>As the student representative to the International Society for Indoor Air Quality and Climate (ISIAQ), I support the next generation of indoor air researchers by coordinating student mentoring, networking, and skill-building workshops. I also lead the 2025 Autumn School in India, planning a two-day event for students prior to the Healthy Buildings Asia conference.</p>
      <p>At WPI, my work bridges environmental engineering and public health through community-engaged research. I am studying the re-emission of wildfire-sourced pollutants from building materials using advanced analytical techniques. I am also interested in how humans perceive and respond to indoor smoke exposure and what behaviors improve resilience.</p>
      <p>Previously, I worked with San Jose State University on home ignition zone evaluations in California, collecting data and using drone imagery to support wildfire preparedness efforts.</p>
