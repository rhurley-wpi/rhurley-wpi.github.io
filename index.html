        <div class="bio">
          <p>I am a second-year PhD student in Civil Engineering at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, advised by Professor Shichao Liu. My research bridges environmental engineering and public health, with a focus on indoor air quality, wildfire smoke exposure, occupant health and behavior. I am eager to learn more about community-engaged research practices, developing smoke or natural disaster readiness plans, and am looking to expand the interdisciplinary nature of my work.</p>
          <p>My current projects examine re-emission of wildfire-sourced pollutants from building materials. Previously, I have investigated the impacts of elevated carbon dioxide exposure due to mask-wearing on student cognition during the COVID-19 pandemic. As an undergraduate student at Lafayette College, my research focused on predicting flash flooding behaviors in the mid Atlantic region.</p>

          <p>I currently serve as the <a href="https://www.isiaq.org/isiaq_board_of_directors.php" target="_blank">student representative to ISIAQ</a>, working with professionals in the field of indoor air to build out student mentoring and activities. In this role I have organized a webinar focused on successful academic paper writing, facilitate the student LinkedIn page and highlight student achievements, and develop networking events for students at conferences. I am working towards expanding the scope of ISIAQ student engagement with more networking opportunities and opportunities for students to share their work with the society. I am also chairing the student engagement committee for the 2025 <a href="https://hb2025.co.in/isiaq-autumn-school.html" target="_blank">Healthy Building Asia Autumn School</a>, where I’m coordinating a two-day international pre-conference program for students.</p>
          <p>I’m currently an intern with Aerodyne Research through the NSF GEOHEALTH INTERN program. This research focuses on smoke transport and the role of building material surfaces in re-emitting deposited pollutants. The project involves the use of VOCUS PTR-ToF-CIMS, which allows real-time mass spectrometry analysis of VOCs in indoor environments.</p>

            In summer 2024, I worked with the <a href="https://fireecology.wixsite.com/katewilkin/people" target="_blank">Home Ignition Zone Project team</a> at San Jose State University to assess community wildfire preparedness using field surveys and drone imagery. We visited homes in three California regions and analyzed how preparedness varies with landscape and built environment characteristics.
